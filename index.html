<h1> Interactive Impedance Simulation </h1>

This website provides an interactive simulation designed to explain 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by analogy with water flow through pipes.
The simulation can be accessed <a href='interactive_impedance.html'>here</a>.
<br><br>
This project was developed to assist with teaching impedance spectroscopy as part of
University-level courses in solid state materials chemistry, with a focus on battery materials.
It is released as an open educational resource for use in other disciplines, however.

<h2> Electrochemical Impedance Overview </h2>

Many materials conduct electricity, for instance metals like copper or iron. How well a material
conducts electricity can be quantified by its resistance, or how well it opposes the flow of charge.
